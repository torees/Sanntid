An atomic operation.
A operation or set of operations is classified as atomic if it reads a location and write in the same (bus) operation. No other devices can write or read on the bus until the atomic operation is completed. 

A semaphore.
A semaphore is a variable used for access control. Different types of semaphores have different applications. A counting semaphore cold be a int which counts available resources accessible to processes. A process will be granted access to utilize a resource if the value of the counting semaphore is larger than zero. A semaphore could also be a Boolean variable, where processes will be allowed access to resources if the value is True. 

A mutex.
A mutex is a mutually exclusive flag.Is a binary form of semaphores. It acts as a gatekeeper for a specific section of code accessible to multiple threads. This is a key concept of multithreaded programming. While a process access a code to alter it, it first sets the mutex(flag) so to indicate to other threads that the resource is in use and have to wait for the flag to be released. This insures problems that could appear if multiple threads alter the same code at the same time(which is obvious)

A critical section
A critical section is principally just a part of a larger code that requires mutual exclusive access, as referred in above sections. It is separated from the rest of the code by different methods, for example mutexes of semaphores. Abstractly, this can be explained as telling the programs processes: â€œYou may access all the code freely, except this part. Here you need to ask permission from the gatekeeper(mutex/semaphore/ect)
